# Machine Learning for XMDS (MLFX)
This project is for my masters thesis for 2020, which aims to implement machine learning to optimise atom interferometer systems.

This package allows for the generation of XMDS scripts in a more Pythonic way, and to optimise specified paremeters within the script.
